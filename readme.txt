Relevant Files:
    "server.c"
        file that contains the server instructions

    "client.c"
        file that contains the client instructions

    "parallelTools.c"
        helper functions for reading/writing data

    "Makefile"
        For compilation

Compilation Instructions:
    Use Makefile to compile the code:
        make all (to compile everything together)
    
    Executables:
        ./server
        ./client

To run the program one should:

I. open two terminal windows and navigate to this directory.
II. $ make all on either window
III. $ ./server on either window (must run before client)
IV. $ ./client on the other window (use "test.txt" for the test file)
V. Observe terminal response.

Included are two successful outputs of the program running on each of the lab partners' machines :D
